## How to use:
- "Scan LAN" to generate list of devices on your current network. Select devices by clicking on them (batch selection allowed)
- "Poison Selected Devices" to conduct an ARP man in the middle attack on the devices. From here, you can specifify a DNS Spoof attack or TCP Dump.
- Select "TCP Dump" and click "Start TCP Dump" to start collecting packets routed from the target, through your device, to the router. Once the user visits a vulnerable site and enters in their login credentials, Sarin will pick it up and display the captured information in the console. Use the cmd+f (search) to look for the keyword "pass", "password", etc. Different sites use different keywords.
- Select "DNS Spoof" and click "Configure" to customize the attack. Under the "configure" menu, the left table is for domain names that, if the user visits, will redirect them to your apache web server. The right column is for cloning a website to host on your web server. After saving your configure options, click "Start DNS Spoof" to start the attack.
- It is in your best interest to stop all attacks before quitting the application. Quitting the application should put a stop to all active processes, but it is recommenced to manually stop the tasks with the "Stop Task" buttons.
